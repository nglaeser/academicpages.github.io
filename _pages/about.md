Hello! I'm a PhD Candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/nglaeser) and the [Max Planck Institute for Security & Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/person/116161/14251) via the [Maryland-Max Planck Program](https://www.cs.umd.edu/maryland-max-planck), jointly advised by [Jonathan Katz](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/) and [Giulio Malavolta](https://sites.google.com/view/giuliomalavolta/). 

I am broadly interested in applied cryptography[^1], especially in the context of blockchains. Last summer I was a research intern at [a16z crypto](https://a16zcrypto.com/research/), and previously at [NTT Research](https://ntt-research.com/cis/). I am also a recipient of the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). 

<span style="color: gray;">*How to pronounce my name: No-Amy Glay-zer*</span>

[^1]: The type of work I aspire to do is described nicely by Gabe Kaptchuk [here](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~kaptchuk/blog/post/work-with-me.html#appliedcrypto).

- **2024-08-14:** The blog post I wrote at a16z crypto last summer is finally [online](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/registration-based-encryption/)! (You can also find it on [this site](papers/onchain_rbe).) In it I compare registration-based encryption (the version from [our 2023 paper](./publications.md#Efficient Registration-Based Encryption)) to previous key distribution approaches for encrypted messaging. (If you don't want to read a whole blog post [here's the Twitter thread version](https://x.com/cryptonoemi/status/1823719451692556704).)
- **2024-05-13:** I'll be presenting [Naysayer proofs](./publications.md#Short paper: Naysayer proofs) and [Cicada](./publications.md#Cicada: A framework for private non-interactive on-chain auctions and voting) on May 25 at the Eurocrypt [Workshop on Cryptographic Tools for Blockchain](https://www.ctb-workshop.org/).
<!-- - **2024-05-06:** I'll be at [ETHBratislava](https://www.ethbratislava.com/) on May 10-11 to talk about [Naysayer proofs](./publications.md#Short paper: Naysayer proofs) and [Cicada](./publications.md#Cicada: A framework for private non-interactive on-chain auctions and voting)! -->
