I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/nglaeser) (with [Jonathan Katz](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/)) and the [Max Planck Institute for Security & Privacy (MPI-SP)](https://www.mpi-sp.org/person/116161/14251) (with [Giulio Malavolta](https://sites.google.com/view/giuliomalavolta/)) via the [Maryland-Max Planck Program(me)](https://www.cs.umd.edu/maryland-max-planck). I am also generously funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
